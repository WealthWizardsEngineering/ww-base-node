In development we've started using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

Nx has the [concept of _affected_](https://nx.dev/latest/node/core-concepts/affected#affected), as in `yarn nx affected:test` or `yarn nx affected:lint`, this uses git to determine differences to a git branch (defaulted to `master`). These [_affected_ commands](https://nx.dev/latest/node/cli/affected) fail when using our default base image because git is not installed.
